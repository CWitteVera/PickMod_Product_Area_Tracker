## IDF Component Manager Manifest File
## Dependencies for main component

dependencies:
  espressif/esp_lvgl_port: "~2.1.0"
  # Pin to esp_lvgl_port 2.1.x which provides LVGL v8.x support
  # Version 2.3+ uses LVGL v9.x which has incompatible API changes
  # This matches the requirement for LVGL v8 parity with EEZ export and the original Espressif demo
