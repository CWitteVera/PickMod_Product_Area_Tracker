## Dependencies for main component

dependencies:
  lvgl/lvgl: "~8.4.0"
  # Explicitly require LVGL v8.4.x to prevent LVGL v9.x from being used
  espressif/esp_lvgl_port: "==2.1.0"
  # Pin to exact esp_lvgl_port 2.1.0 which provides stable LVGL v8.x support
  # Version 2.1.1+ may have LVGL v9 code paths with API issues
  # Version 2.3+ uses LVGL v9.x which has incompatible API changes
  # This matches the requirement for LVGL v8 parity with EEZ export and the original Espressif demo
